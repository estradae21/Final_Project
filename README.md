# Final_Project
Final project for android. Application is still being brain stormed 

This assignment is open-ended. You are to use your creativity to develop an Android App while sticking to the stated guidelines. Here are the guidelines for the assignment.
The App should be original to you. How the App works and what it looks like should not be one found in any tutorials or elsewhere.
The App should make use of one or more sensors.
The App should do at least two of the following:
Use persistance.
Get information from a server.
Interact with another App on this device using Intents.
Interact with another device using Bluetooth or some other means.
Something else like these. Get an OK from me BEFORE you begin. 
It is not better to ask forgiveness than ask permission.
The App should interact with the user.
